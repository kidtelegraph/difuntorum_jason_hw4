CSS Cascade, Selection and
Pseudo Selectors

Exploring Authoring Techniques with CSS - Authoring 1

Assignment Description
Use the in-class ToDo list as your starting point. Use generic selectors to add some style /
visual updates to the page.
Follow the steps listed below to add functionality with CSS, selectors and the ::before and
::after pseudo selectors. Use the reference links provided in the Week 11 module..
Create a well-written readme file and branches as necessary, following workflow as
demonstrated in class. Use pull requests and merge as you go.

Assignment Requirements
Follow the steps described below to update the ToDo list using CSS.
1. Add a background image of some kind to the page - theme it however you like, but it
should have something to do with a “to-do” list
2. Add a header to the page and use an H1 tag (and others, if you like) to give your
page a creative title. Use an ID attribute and CSS selector to style the header and its
content.
3. Use generic element selectors, IDs and classes where appropriate and make the
build your own - change colors, fonts, etc. Feel free to explore Google Fonts as a
solution.
4. Add an input element with a type of checkbox to each “in progress” and each “done”
list item in the “in progress” and “done” lists.
5. When you check an “in progress” list item, use the appropriate selector to also
/additionally select the entire list item’s content and set their color appropriately.
6. When you check a “done” item, use the appropriate selector to also /additionally
select the entire list item’s content and set their color appropriately.
7. Use the ::after pseudo selector to add a graphic element indicating completion
(check, thumbs up, etc)

Additional Information
Missed tests/exams will not be rescheduled without some valid evidence of some important
event over which the student has no control (e.g., Court appearance, death in the family).
Missed tests or exams, therefore, can receive a zero. The students are advised to notify the
professor prior to missing the test.

Students are expected to hand in all assignments to the course instructor on the due date,
and all assignments must be submitted in the format specified by the instructor (e.g., on
FOL, in printed form, on a specific lab computer, etc.); assignments will not be accepted in
any format other than that specified.

Late assignments will not be accepted, nor will make up test or assignments be permitted,
without some valid evidence of some important event over which the student has no control
(e.g., documented illness, death in the family). Missed tests or assignments, therefore, will
receive a mark of zero. Late assignments and make-up tests will only be permitted following
the submission of adequate documentation acceptable to the instructor (e.g., a doctor's
note). Students are advised to notify the instructor prior to missing an assignment due date
or a scheduled test.

Immediately upon return from an illness/absence in which a test or assignment has been
missed, the student is responsible for contacting the course instructor to discuss the
problem. The instructor will make arrangements for any student deemed eligible. The
alternative test/assignment will be of equal value to the one missed with no grade penalty.
The timeline and due dates will be determined by the course instructor.

At mid-term, any unsatisfactory results will be reported to the student.
This course may be revised by the professor with suitable notification to the students.
Students are responsible for making arrangements to pick up missed handouts, assignments
and course announcements from classmates.

Plagiarism (e.g., failure to acknowledge sources used, submitting another student's work
under your name, or producing work for another student to submit) is a serious academic
offense that shall result in appropriate penalties, to be determined at the discretion of the
course professor in consultation with the chairperson of the Communication Arts division.
The penalties shall range from failure of an assignment to possible failure of the course.
Students shall not make the assumption that any provision will be made by the professor to
permit the student to rewrite or redo failed assignments
